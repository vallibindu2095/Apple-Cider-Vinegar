# APPLE CIDER - VINEGAR
## Introduction
>The majority of carbohydrate sources can be converted into vinegar. It comes about as a result of fermentation, a process in which yeast and bacteria break down the sugars in food.Yeast converts these carbohydrates to alcohol,and *Aceto-bacter bacteria* convert the alcohol to *acetic acid* or *vinegar*. Apples that have been crushed or pulverised are fermented to produce *Apple Cider Vinegar* `(ACV)`

## Processing
>ACV, often known as apple cider vinegar, is created by fermenting apple juice. Juice is recovered by pressing and crushing apples that have been cultivated properly. To begin the fermentation in which the carbohydrates in the apple fruit are converted to alcohol - which results in the *alcoholic fermentation process* - yeast and excellent edible bacteria are introduced.
Furthermore, Aceto-bacter, or bacteria that produce acetic acid, uses this alcohol to create vinegar. After that, *acetic and malic acids* are mixed and added to the vinegar to give it a sour flavour.
